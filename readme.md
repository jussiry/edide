This repository will include code for creating your own :editor servers.
For now :editor is only available at http://jussir.net

Main purpose for this repository now is issue tracker. Feel free to use it also for
general discussion, since other forums don't exist.

Docs to be added. See: http://edide.xyz/#/edit/tutorials
